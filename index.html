      <h2>EDEN: Electrified Distributed Energy Network Tree Campaign</h2>
      <p>
        The EDEN initiative—Electrified Distributed Energy Network—invites churches, neighborhood groups, and founder-donors to sponsor a “solar tree node” in our network. These solar trees, arranged like structural canopies, collect sunlight and store energy for flexible use in homes, businesses, or electric vehicle charging.

          <h3>Why EDEN?</h3>
          <p>A faith-and-community aligned launch strategy to seed the DER network in places that say “yes” fastest.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>What It Funds</h3>
          <p>Structural solar tree canopies, lithium-ion battery storage systems, and on-site EV charging service loads.</p>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Where It Goes</h3>
          <p>Cities in Texas and DeKalb County (Decatur, Georgia, USA) are the first deployment zones — and the model is replicable nationwide.</p>

      <h2>Urban Marvel “Hive” Electric Vehicle Fleet & Driving School</h2>
      <p>
        Each solar tree supports an associated service: EV rental, local corporate fleet charging, and a driving school built for next-generation mobility. This is how we turn distributed energy resource capacity into daily revenue and service.

      <h2>How This Becomes a Virtual Power Plant</h2>
      <p>
        We aggregate many small, tree-like distributed energy resource (DER) nodes — each featuring photovoltaic panels, battery storage, and vehicle-to-grid capable EVs — and a market-based controller dispatches power dynamically every few minutes. This operational pattern is rooted in “Power Management in Advanced Life-Support Systems Using Market-Based Control,” originally developed at NASA Ames, and scaled here for civilian grid services.
      </p>
      <p>
        As we expand, we match the business model found in the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) studies of DER aggregation to monetize flexibility and grid services — allowing us to operate without traditional utility-scale capital ownership.
